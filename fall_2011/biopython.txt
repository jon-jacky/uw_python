BioPython demo - packages, files, strings, regular expressions

 Problem: find a pattern in a protein
   - ceru_human is human ceruloplasmin (see refs in file itself)
   - PS00079 is a prosite pattern, "Multicopper oxidases signature"

 Data in file format called SwissProt (after database)

 Usee BioPython package to help analyze it (must be installed)
 
 BioPython has modules to read SwissProt files and many many others

 Open the file, get fd

 Use SwissProt.read to get record with attributes
  this read is defined in BioPython.SwissProt, not same read as book 14.8, 166

 We're interested in r.sequence, a string, that's what we'll search

 Using re in Python: compile, then search returns match object with m.start etc.

 A (one-off) script: ad-lib programming in interpreter, 
   then save in module.  No functions are defined.

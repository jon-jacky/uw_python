 Exercise 5A - Write a function sorted_string that takes one string
  argument and returns a string with the same characters but sorted in
  lexical (alphabetic) order.  You may use the list sort method, but
  you may NOT use the built-in library function 'sorted' in your
  solution.  Write your function in a module also named sorted_string
  that defines at least two test strings.  In your module, call your
  function on each of these strings and print the results.

 Exercise 5B - Write a function sorted_list that takes one list
  argument and returns a list with the same elements but sorted.  This
  function must NOT change the list in the caller.  You may use the
  list sort method, but you may NOT use the built-in library function
  'sorted' in your solution.  Write your function in a module also
  named sorted_list that defines at least two test strings.  In your
  module, call your function on each of these lists and print the
  results.  Also, print both lists after calling the function to show
  that they have not changed.

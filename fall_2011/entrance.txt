Lab 

 Make and run a Python module, for example, your solution to the entrance exam:

   "Write a program IN PYTHON that takes a single array parameter and
    returns the decimal average of the input values"

 ... or some other example
 
 Not to turn in - the point is to just begin working with the language and tools

 IDLE is recommended but not necessary - you can use your favorite editor

 Discuss Lab

  Vague requirements: "program"?  "array parameter"? "returns"? "decimal average"?

  Show several different solutions 

  Script? Function?

  Problem "takes an integer array parameter"  function arg? command line arg?

  Pitfall: integer arithmetic

  for ... vs. sum(...)

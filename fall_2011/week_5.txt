 Re Exercise due last week: most_frequent.py
   Surprising number of variations
   See .../fall_2011/comments_4.txt 
   Test case: 'abbcccddddeeee'
   Some students used built-in Python machinery to solve the problem: 
     s.count(c) counts character c in string s
     collections.Counter class new in 2.7 does almost everything
       initializer creates histogram, most_frequent method does the sorting


 Lightning talks: Diana Martinez, John McRae, Tony Mince, Michele Wickham

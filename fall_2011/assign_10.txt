Exercise: Find and install a Python package and report your
experience.  Report these items:

 1. The name of the package 

 2. Location where you found the package (the URL for the website, the
 entry in package manager registry, etc.)

 3. The format of the downloaded package, if any (.msi, .dmg, .tar.gz, ...
    or 'none' if installation method doesn't use one)

 4. The installation program you used (distutils, pip, easy_install,
     apt, Synaptic, macports ...)

 5. Whether the installation was successful 

If the installation was not successful, you don't have to fix it if
you don't want to -- just report that it didn't work.  If you do fix
it, report that.

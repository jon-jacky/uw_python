Decorator-generator exercise

 Problem-solving method: write the skeleton that the problem statement determines

   def generator(f):  # decorator takes function argument, f argument is scalar x
       def gen(s):    # decorator defines a function, argument is iterable s
         ....
         yield ....   # a generator uses yield not return
       return gen     # decorator returns the function it defines
   
  Then fill in the body ... then try it on the test case ... it works!

      def gen(s):
        for x in s:    # s is an iterable, so iterate
           yield f(x)  # now we have x, apply f and yield the result

  Alterntively, can return generator expression, no yield needed

    def gen(s):
       return (f(x) for x in s) # (...) not [...] makes generator

Decorator-generator

 "wraps" decorator *in the decorator* - optional, preserves docstring in f etc.

   from functools import wraps
   def generator(f):
        @wraps(f)
        def gen(s):  
           ...

Internet Programming in Python

 Starts Tues Jan 3, three weeks from tonight!  

 Syllabus and first week reading assignment already online
   http://staff.washington.edu/jon/uw_python/winter_2012/

 Survey many topics:
  Build up from sockets through web applications
  Not just Django web framework, though we'll spend time on it

 Not just Python
  Learn tools that are currently popular (essential, really)
   might require a lot of time, effort in itself
  Git at GitHub - for storing and handing in assignments
  Linux VMs at Blue Box Group - remote hosts for running network applications
  Get started by installing Git on your computer (also ssh, scp on Windows)
  We will spend the first class meeting on this, BUT be prepared

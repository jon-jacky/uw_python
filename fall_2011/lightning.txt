 Demo: Schedule the lightning talks

  Read class list from file into Python list

  Shuffle to randomize order

  Week numbers * n, as many as needed for all students

  Zip to associate week numbers with names

  Sort to collect together all talks for same week

  Open file, print with for name, week in ... print ...
  (preview next course: reading/writing web site not much harder than file)

  Save statements in a module so we can repeat as needed

  import the module into session, demo dir and help, note docstring
   docstrings can occur in many python constructs.  Not just comments, but better

  We've just demonstrated a crude but often effective programming method!

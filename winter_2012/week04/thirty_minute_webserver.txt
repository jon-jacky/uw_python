thirty_minute_webserver.txt
+--

Assignment: modify the thirty minute webserver, try one or both:

Easier: Support a date-time url, so .../date.html causes the server
to send a page that shows the current date and time.

Harder: Support .py urls, so .../foo.py causes the server to execute
foo.py and send a page that shows its output.  Test it with print_time.py
that outputs a page that shows the current date and time.

Week 7 Lab: Flask

 Install Flask on your computer

 Revise echo_flask.py to show all the messages received since startup.
  Suggestion: experiment with formatting the output page.  What if 
  you return a big string?  HTML?  Does the templating system help?  

 To install, consult http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/ 
  -- but I didn't take their advice.  I do not recommend virtualenv
  I do not have pip installed so I tried  sudo easy_install Flask
   worked for me, installed Flask 0.8, Jinja2 2.6, Werkzeug 0.8.3

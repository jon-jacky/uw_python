Web applications are projects

  Multiple files, packages, etc.
  Advanced coding idioms: decorators etc.
  Systematic testing

  Would like some organizing principles, "design patterns"

MVC architecure - Model, View, Controller

 Separate content from (visual) design
    might have lots of different ways to view the same data
 Keep the model (application data) and the views (web pages) independent

 model: application data, Python global variables, database ...
 view: web pages, templates ...
 controller: URL routing ...

 Flask "view functions": decorated with @app.route, generate pages

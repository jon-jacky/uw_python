Lab, week 3:

Write the 'Hello world' web application.  In our git repository create
a subdirectory hello_www.  Write a python program hello_www.py that
listens on port 8081, then when a client connects to that port and
sends a valid HTTP GET request for hello.html, your program sends an
HTTP response including the HTML for a web page that contains your
github username and the text 'Hello, world'.

Test your program on localhost, point your browser at 
http://localhost:8081/hello.html.  Then run your program on your VM,
and test it by pointing your browser at 

 http://block335026-fa5.blueboxgrid.com:8081/hello.html

(but with your vm host name).

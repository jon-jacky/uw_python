Lab, week 3:

Write the minimal 'Hello world' web application.  Write a python
program hello_www.py that listens on port 8081, then when a client
connects to that port and sends an HTTP request, your program sends an
HTTP response including the HTML for a web page that contains your
github username and the text 'Hello, world'.

Test your program on localhost, point your browser at 
http://localhost:8081/  Then run your program on your VM,
and test it by pointing your browser at 

 http://block335026-fa5.blueboxgrid.com:8081

(but with your vm host name).

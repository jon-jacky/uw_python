The Internet

 One of the most significant inventions of the 20th century --- maybe ever!

 All-purpose world-wide fast information storage and communication system
  person-to-person, broadcasting, everything in between - anyone can join in!

 Designers always intended participation/contribution, not just consumption
   -- not just a replacement for TV, newspapers, mail-order catalogs ...
   -- low barriers to participation, almost everyone can join in
   -- not limited to just adding content -- you can create your own services

 On the Internet, you use and provide services - web sites are just one kind
  Services are sort of like Python libraries - data, functions you can use 

 Any Python program can be turned into an Internet service (web site or ...)

 Any Internet service (web site or ...) can be used like a Python library

"Internet Programming in Python" course content
  Most content is generic, would not be much different in Ruby, Java, ... 

 Emphasize the Internet as a collection of programmable services 
  Many services these days are web sites, but not all
  Learn to use services: treat a service as if it were a Python library
  Learn to provide services: make a Python program or library into a service

 Bottom up, work up the protocol stack - axiomatic, operational approach
  Start with sockets - lowest level convenient and commonly used interface
  Then HTTP, then screen scraping and web APIs, then CGI, WSGI, Web framework

 Web Frameworks
  Simple and complex - probably Flask, definitely Django
  Learn to be critical, choose an appropriate framework, use it "a la carte"

 Survey course, not in-depth, must omit some important topics
  Emphasize server-side, minimal clients, no CSS or Javascript programming
  Almost nothing on security, authentication - all your work is totally public
   ALL YOUR WORK IS TOTALLY PUBLIC! No passwords, credit cards, patient names

Technology and tools

 Much emphasis on technology and tools, especially --
  Linux operating system: Internet hosts are Linux VMs from Blue Box group 
  Git distributed version control system: GitHub stores and displays your work

 Learning Linux and Git
  First class is mostly a lab to get your workflow going with Linux and Git
   Learn typical workflow by rote, from examples. Should be sufficient.
  Later: answer questions during in-class labs, maybe some lecture if needed
  
 See directories.txt, workflow.txt, directions.txt, assignment.txt

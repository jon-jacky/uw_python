Optional laboratory for week 2 - 3

Experiment with socket buffers.  Review the Socket Programming HOWTO,
http://docs.python.org/howto/sockets.html, the section Using a Socket,
especially paragraph 3, "Now we come (to) the major stumbling block
..."  Try sending buffers of various lengths, including some very long
ones.  Try receiving with different values for the bufsize argument.
You can experiment by just typing into the python interpreter at the 
client and server ends, or write fragments of code and import them.
Examine the behavior when both client and server are on localhost, 
and then when the server is on your VM.

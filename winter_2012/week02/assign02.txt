Assignment 2:

Run echo_server_select on localhost and test with two or more simultaneous
recho clients (from lab 2) in different terminal windows.

In a new chat subdirectory, write a chat server based on
echo_server_select.  When any client sends a message, that message is
echoed to all clients, prefixed by the identification of the client
that sent the message (as well as the server that sent the message).

Test your chat server with two or more recho clients on localhost.
Will these servers work as intended with the recho client?  Why not?
If not, write a chat client, test your chat server with two or more
chat clients on local host, then run them on your VM.

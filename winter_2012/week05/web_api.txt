Web APIs 

  Use a web site AS IF it were a Python library
   HTTP request is a like a function call
   HTTP response is like a return value
  Write a program that calls functions provided by the site
   (that you don't usually see in the browser)
  The site must design and publish an API
   many sites do these days  
  Much more robust than screen scraping
   APIs are not affected by cosmetic changes in site design
   APIs change too, but sites often support old APIs also

Two styles of Web API

  XML RPC, SOAP, WS-xxx etc. etc. etc.
   complicated, unfashionable
   still lots of examples in the wild   

  REST with JSON 
   sometimes simpler, considered very cool

Web API calls - XML RPC (etc) vs REST

 How to express function call/return in HTTP?

 XML RPC (also SOAP, WS-XXX etc. )
  Call is encoded in XML in request body
  Return value is encoded in XML in response body

 REST 
  Call is encoded in the method (GET, POST, ...) + URL itself
  Return value is encoded in JSON in response body

Data formats - HTTP responses

 HTTP response need not be HTML, can be any data
  Response header identifies what kind
    Content-type: text/html   
  is typical but could also be
   image/gif  text/javascript application/json ... etc. ...

 Some response types are designed to represent data for web APIs
  XML
  JSON

 Python standard libraries for parsing both formats
  Convert strings in XML (etc.) to Python lists, dictionaries...

Data formats - XML and JSON

 XML - looks like HTML - braketed tags, nesting
  but tags can be customized

  <foo>
    ....
   <bar> ... 
   </bar>
  </foo> 

 JSON - Javascript dictionaries and arrays, much like in Python

Notable Web APIs

  Google - http://code.google.com/more/table/
  Freebase - http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/What_is_Freebase%3F

  others in "zoo" linked to course web page

  Huge data + programs you couldn't install on your own computer

Mashups

 A web site made of data from other websites
 example: <whatever> on Google maps

Assignment: choose one or more

1. File downloader: write a script that scrapes our Python Winter 2012
course page for the URLs of all the Python source files, then
downloads them all.

WARNING: When testing any automated web client, take care not to
overdo it -- don't overload the server.  In this case the server is
github; each run of your program imposes a similar load as cloning the
repository.  Test your program progressively: first, confirm you are
scraping the Python URLs correctly before testing any code to download
them.  Then, test downloading from a local cloned (by hand) copy of
the repository, using file: urls (not http:).  When that's working,
try downloading from github.  See the github terms of service at
http://help.github.com/terms-of-service/

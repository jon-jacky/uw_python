Web Clients - programs that use the web

  We could easily have a 10 week course on this!  

  The browser is just one kind of web client.
  
  A program can use a web site as if it were a library.

  Screen scraping - write a program that processes the same HTML you see.

  Web API - write a program that calls functions provided by the site 
             (that you don't usually see in the browser).

Getting web page contents

  In your browser:  Show source (menu item) 
 
  At the command line:  curl -i ... ( -i option also shows headers)

  In Python: page = urllib2.urlopen(...) # from the standard library
                                          OR requests library -

Screen scraping 

 Write a program that processes the same HTML you see

 Very fragile because web sites change screen designs all the time
 
 Three approaches (at least)
   String library
   Regular expressions
   Specialized library that knows HTML syntax
     "Parse" - turn HTML string into Python data structures
     BUT many pages have "broken" HTML (don't obey official syntax)
     Beautiful Soup to the rescue!

Lab - CGI

 Download echo_cgi.html and in same directory, create cgi-bin directory
 Download cgi_test.py, echo_cgi.py into cgi-bin directory.
  (git pull from uw_python will do all this automatically)

 In same directory as echo_cgi.html and cgi-bin directory, execute this:

   python -m CGIHTTPServer

 Point your browser at http://localhost:8000/cgi_test.py and observe the result
  then http://localhost:8000/cgi_test.py?message=Hello  and observe the result
  then http://localhost:8000/echo_cgi.html fill out the form, submit, observe...

 If you have time, do the same on your VM
 If you dare, configure Apache on your VM to run CGI, try cgi_test and echo_cgi
  see apache_howto.txt

Web servers vs. applications, system and server administration

  Examples so far: web server and web application are the SAME program
  Typical organization SEPARATES web server from web application
  Web server handles generic services needed by any web site
   Serves many applications (programs), in different programming languages
   Managing sockets, multiple connections (like our chat example, but many more)
   Access, permissions, authorization
   Redirection, proxies
   etc. ... See docs on how to configure Apache etc.
  Small servers used for development: ws30, SimpleHTTPServer, Django etc. ..
  Industrial strength servers for big sites: Apache, Nginx, Twisted, IIS (MS), ...
   configuring and running these is a job, a career path ...
  Servers seen by Python devs usually run on Linux

CGI - Common Gateway Interface 

 A way to put almost ANY program on the web (not just Python)
  "almost any", no socket wrangling needed, all handled by server
 The ORIGINAL way to put programs on the web, influence is still pervasive 
   simple, supported everywhere, always works as a last resort

  1. Put myprogram.py in cgi-bin directory on server, (say) www.acme.com
  2. Point client at http://www.acme.com/cgi-bin/myprogram.py
  3. Server runs myprogram.py, collects its output, serves to client

 myprogram.py starts up and runs to completion EACH TIME a client connects.
 Much like our ws30.py exercise.  BUT - how to you get INPUTS to myprogram.py?

CGI - sources of input

  All data must come from HTTP request: URL, headers, POST body
  HTML forms are the typical way for user to provide data
  HTML forms contents can be encoded in URL or POST body  

  (demo? lab?  provide sample HTML forms with both URLS and POST)

CGI program can get its inputs from ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

   Environment variables similar to program variables but system-wide
    A way for programs to communicate with each other
    Can be read, set at command line:
     Unix (Linux, Mac):  echo $VAR       export VAR=value   printenv
     Windows:            echo %VAR%      set VAR value      set
    In Python, environment variables are in a dictionary
     import os
     os.environ['VAR']           # to read, look up in dictionary
     os.environ['VAR'] = ....    # to set, assign in dictionary

CGI environment variables

  Server reads HTTP request, assigns environment variables
  CGI program can then read the environment variables 
  CGI standard defines which environment variables must be set

  http://www.citycat.ru/doc/CGI/overview/env.html
  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-robinson-www-interface-00

  Particularly important, used to store forms data: 
   REQUEST_METHOD (GET, POST etc.) CONTENT_LENGTH, QUERY_STRING
  
  Not just Python - environment variables can be read by any language

CGI Python library
  
  Higher-level alternative to getting forms data
  Deals with GET and POST

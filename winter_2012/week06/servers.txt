Web servers vs. applications, system and server administration

  Examples so far: web server and web application are the SAME program
  Typical organization SEPARATES web server from web application
  Web server handles generic services needed by any web site
   Serves many applications (programs), in different programming languages
   Managing sockets, multiple connections (like our chat example, but many more)
   Access, permissions, authorization
   Redirection, proxies
   etc.
  Small servers used for development: ws30, SimpleHTTPServer, Django etc. ..
  Industrial strength servers for big sites: Apache, Nginx, Twisted, IIS (MS), ...
   configuring and running these is a job, a career path ...
  Servers seen by Python devs usually run on Linux

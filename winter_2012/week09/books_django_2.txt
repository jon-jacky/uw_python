Week 9 Assignment: Books web site (continued)

Continue working on the books web site begun in week 8.
Extend the site any way you wish.  Some suggestions:

- Make it pretty - add style sheet, .css file in books/static/
- Figure out unittest and django.test, add more tests in tests.py
- Add admin interface for adding books, authorizing users
- Add search (add search form page, return index page of all books that match)
- Get logins working in bookshop
- Add shopping cart (collection of books for each user)
- ... etc. ...

OR - Do something fun and interesting: build another website on any
  subject of your choice, using any technology (Django, Flask, WSGI,...),
   or build a client or ...  maybe start on Spring your quarter project
